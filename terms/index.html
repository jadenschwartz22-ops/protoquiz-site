      <h1>Terms of Use (End User License Agreement)</h1>
      <p class="updated"><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

      <h2>Who we are and what this is</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Use are a legal agreement between you and Teach Me to Live LLC, a Colorado company, covering your use of the EMS Protocol Quiz & Scenarios mobile app and related websites and services (collectively, the "App"). By installing or using the App, you accept these Terms.</p>

      <h2>Educational use only; no medical advice</h2>
      <p>The App is an educational study tool for EMTs, paramedics, and students. It <strong>does not provide medical advice</strong>, is not a medical device, and <strong>must not be used to diagnose, treat, triage, or guide real-time patient care, emergencies, or clinical decision-making</strong>. The App does not replace your training, clinical judgment, medical direction, or your jurisdiction's official protocols. Always consult and follow your local protocols and medical direction.</p>

      <h2>Who may use the App</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you live) to use the App. You may use the App only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws.</p>

      <h2>Content sources and accuracy</h2>
      <p>Many referenced protocol materials are sourced from publicly available or public-domain documents. We curate, normalize, summarize, and create quizzes and scenarios. While we aim for accuracy, protocols change and may vary by jurisdiction. The App and all content are provided "as is" and may contain errors or omissions. You are responsible for verifying any information against your official protocol sources.</p>

      <h2>License and restrictions</h2>
      <p>We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App for your personal, non-commercial study. You may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copy, distribute, or publicly display large portions of question banks or scenarios</li>
        <li>Scrape or export content at scale</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or circumvent technical protections</li>
        <li>Use the App to compete with us</li>
        <li>Use it in lieu of studying your official protocols</li>
        <li>Use it in any unlawful, harmful, or deceptive way</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User submissions and feedback</h2>
      <p>If you send feedback, suggestions, corrections, or content ideas, you grant Teach Me to Live LLC a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, host, modify, and incorporate them without obligation to you.</p>

      <h2>Subscriptions, trials, and billing</h2>
      <p>The App may offer paid subscriptions and, at times, free trials. Billing and renewal are processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play ("Platform"). We do not receive your full payment information. Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each term unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the current period ends. Manage or cancel in your device account settings (Apple ID Subscriptions or Google Play Subscriptions). Deleting the App does not cancel an active subscription.</p>

      <p><strong>Price/Feature Changes.</strong> We may change subscription pricing or features; any change takes effect in the next billing period after we or the Platform provide notice, subject to the Platform's rules. If a required consent is not provided, your subscription may end at the current period's close.</p>

      <p><strong>iOS note:</strong> Where the App Store requires consent for a price increase, your subscription will not renew at the higher price unless you consent in the App Store; otherwise it will end at the current term.</p>

      <p><strong>Android note:</strong> Price changes follow Google Play policies; if required, you'll receive notice and may need to review/accept the new price in Google Play.</p>

      <p><strong>Trials.</strong> If a trial is offered, it converts to a paid subscription at the end of the trial unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Eligibility and duration may vary by Platform.</p>

      <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> All refunds are handled by the Platform and are subject to the Platform's refund policies. We do not offer direct refunds, credits, or prorations for partial periods except where required by law.</p>

      <p><strong>Taxes &amp; Currency.</strong> Prices may exclude taxes and fees, which the Platform may add based on your billing address. Charges are in the currency shown by the Platform.</p>

      <p><strong>Failed Payments.</strong> If the Platform cannot collect payment, access to paid features may be suspended or canceled.</p>

      <p><strong>Consumer Rights.</strong> Nothing in this section limits any non-waivable consumer rights you may have under applicable law.</p>

      <h2>Acceptable use and enforcement</h2>
      <p>You agree not to misuse the App, including by sharing answer keys or large sets of questions, bypassing access controls, or using the App for commercial training without our written consent. We may suspend or terminate access if we believe you violate these Terms, pose risk, or engage in abuse.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>Except where third-party rights apply, Teach Me to Live LLC owns the App and its compilation, selection, design, and original content. Third-party names and materials remain the property of their respective owners.</p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The App may link to or depend on third-party services (for example, app stores, analytics, crash reporting). Those services are governed by their own terms and policies.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>The App is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including accuracy, completeness, reliability, noninfringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Teach Me to Live LLC does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that defects will be corrected. <strong>The App is not a substitute for professional training, medical advice, or your official protocols.</strong></p>

      <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Teach Me to Live LLC and its owners, officers, employees, and contractors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; loss of data; loss of profits or revenues; or any harm arising from clinical use or reliance on the App. Our total liability for any claim related to the App is limited to the greater of $50 USD or the amounts you paid to us for the App in the twelve months before the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; those limits apply only to the extent permitted.</p>

      <h2>Indemnity</h2>
      <p>You will indemnify and hold Teach Me to Live LLC harmless from claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your misuse of the App, violation of these Terms, or infringement of third-party rights.</p>

      <h2>Dispute resolution, arbitration, and venue</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Informal resolution.</strong> Contact us first so we can try to resolve issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Binding arbitration and class-action waiver.</strong> Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App will be resolved by binding individual arbitration under the Rules of the American Arbitration Association. No class actions or representative proceedings. You and we waive the right to a jury trial.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt-out.</strong> You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by emailing <a href="mailto:jaden@protoquiz.com">jaden@protoquiz.com</a> with your name and a statement that you opt out of arbitration.</li>
        <li><strong>Small claims.</strong> Either party may bring an individual claim in small-claims court in Denver County, Colorado.</li>
        <li><strong>Governing law and venue.</strong> Colorado law governs these Terms, without regard to conflicts principles. For claims that are not arbitrated and not in small-claims court, the exclusive venue is the state and federal courts in Denver County, Colorado.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional terms for iOS users (Apple App Store)</h2>
      <p>If you obtained the App through Apple's App Store or use it on an Apple-branded device, the following terms apply in addition to (and, where permitted, superseding) the terms above to satisfy Apple's Licensed Application End User License Agreement requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgement.</strong> This EULA is between you and Teach Me to Live LLC only, not Apple. We, not Apple, are solely responsible for the App and its content.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope of license.</strong> The license is nontransferable and permits you to use the App on Apple-branded products you own or control, as allowed by the App Store Usage Rules (including any Family Sharing/volume purchase rules that apply).</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance and support.</strong> We are solely responsible for maintenance and support of the App; Apple has no obligation to provide any support services.</li>
        <li><strong>Warranty.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no warranty obligation with respect to the App, and any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure of the App to conform to any warranty are our responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Product claims.</strong> We are responsible for addressing any of your or a third party's claims relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including: (i) product-liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer-protection, privacy, or similar legislation.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual property rights.</strong> In the event of a third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party's intellectual-property rights, we—not Apple—will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such claim.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance.</strong> You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo or designated as "terrorist supporting," and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Developer name and contact.</strong> Teach Me to Live LLC is the Application Provider; contact details appear at the end of these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party-beneficiary.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this EULA, and that, upon your acceptance of the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the EULA against you as a third-party beneficiary.</li>
        <li><strong>External services.</strong> Use of any third-party services accessed through the App (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, or external content) may be subject to those services' own terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms. If we make material changes, we will notify you in the App or on our site. Your continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or if we discontinue the App. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive.</p>

      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms or any rights hereunder without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Entire agreement.</strong> These Terms are the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App and supersede prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject.</li>
      </ul>
